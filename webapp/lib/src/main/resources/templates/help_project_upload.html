<br>
<h4>Project Upload</h4>
<p>For authorised users, i.e., Project Creators and Repository Administrators, PODD provides the option of uploading a new Project in the form of an RDF file. For this purpose, there is an <Strong>Upload Project as RDF</Strong> button listed on the Listing Projects screen. Once the button is clicked, the <Strong>Upload new Project</Strong> page is displayed.</p> 

<p>The <strong>Upload new Project</strong> page requires the user to select a file containing the project details and upload it as shown in Figure 10.5.1.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img style="width: 376px; height: 193px;" border="1" alt="Upload new Project" src="${baseUrl}/resources/images/project_upload.jpg" /></p>
<p class="rteleft">&nbsp;Figure 10.5.1 &ndash; Screenshot of the Upload new Project page</p>

<p>Once the Upload button is clicked, the RDF file is uploaded to the PODD server, validated and a new Project created.</p>
<p>If the Project is successfully created, the following screen is displayed.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img style="width: 681px; height: 262px;" border="1" alt="Upload Project Successful" src="${baseUrl}/resources/images/project_upload_success.jpg" /></p>

<p>A Project is stored as an Ontology inside PODD. The screen displays information about this ontology:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
	<li>Ontology IRI: A URI which identifies this Project</li>
	<li>Version IRI: A URI which identifies the current version of the Project</li>
	<li>Inferred IRI: A URI which identifies inferred data about the current version of the Project</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not necessary for users of the PODD HTML interface to know about these URIs.</p>
