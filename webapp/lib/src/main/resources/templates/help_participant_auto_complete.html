<h3 class="underlined_heading">Auto-completion Functionality</h3>
<br>
<p>User Auto-completion is a very useful function in PODD. The system lists all users that match the characters typed in the field. The user can then select the Project Participant from the appearing list without typing the complete user name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 10.2.1.1 shows an example of the functionality. When &quot;re&quot; is typed in the Project Member field, a drop down list which displays all users with letters &quot;re&quot; in their user name, first name or last name pops up. The search is not case-sensitive. The user can select the desired user from this list.</p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>Figure 10.2.1.1 &ndash; Detail showing selectable list to autocomplete fields</em></p>
<p>The detailed process of the auto-completion functionality is described as follows:</p>
<ol class="stylized-decimal">
    <li>The user starts to type in the required field.</li>
    <li>After at least 2 characters are typed, the system will list all available users that:
	    <ul class="stylized">
		    <li>Have a first name that contains the character combination,</li>
		    <li>Have a last name that contains the character combination, or</li>
		    <li>Have a username that contains the character combination.</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
    <li>As the user types in subsequent letters, numbers or symbols the list will be further filtered.</li>
    <li>The list will be in the form of a drop down box below the required text field.</li>
    <li>Each entry in the list contains the full name and institution of the user.</li>
    <li>The user can use the up and down arrow keys to select the desired project participant.</li>
    <li>The user hits enter once the selection is made (or clicks on a selection), and the text field is updated with the full name and institution of the participant.</li>
	<li>The user clicks the <strong>Add</strong> button or leaves the text field to confirm adding the participant.</li>
	<li>The text field is cleared and the PODD server updated in the background.</li>
</ol>
