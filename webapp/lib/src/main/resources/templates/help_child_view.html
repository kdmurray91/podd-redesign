<h3 class="underlined_heading">Viewing a Child Object</h3>
<br>
<p>The <strong>View Object</strong> screen is arrived as a result of <strong>Adding a Child </strong>object or <strong>Editing an Object.</strong> It can also be displayed by clicking the object title from any screen where it is displayed as a hyperlink (E.g. View Object, Object Hierarchy).</p>
<p>The <strong>View Object</strong> screen is displayed as follows (See figure 14.2.1). The following sections are displayed in the View Object page:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Parent Details</li>
    <li>Object Details</li>
    <li>File Attachment</li>
</ul>
<p>All the sections are displayed in an expanded state by default. At the bottom of the page, available action buttons are listed for the user.</p>

<br>
<h4>Parent Details</h4>
<p>The first section of the <strong>View Object </strong>screen is the <strong>Parent Details</strong> section. It contains:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Parent object URI</li>
    <li>Parent object Type</li>
    <li>Parent object Title</li>
    <li>Parent-Child relationship</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Object Details</h4>
<p>The Second section is the <strong>Object Details</strong> section. The title of this section is determined by the object type and the object details too depend on the object type. For the object being viewed, it presents:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
	<li>Available attributes</li>
	<li>Child objects (if any exist)</li>
	<li>Refers To objects (if any exist)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>File Attachment</h4>
<p>The next section is the <strong>File attachments</strong> section. All the attached file references are listed with their descriptions. The File details can be viewed by clicking the file name link.</p>
<br>
<!--
<h4>Hierarchy</h4>
<p>The <strong>Hierarchy</strong> section is the similar to the one in the Viewing Project screen except that the project object does not have a parent object. As stated under the Hierarchy header: Hierarchy displays only the parent and existing children of the current object. It displays entries for:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>The current object's Parent Object;</li>
    <li>The current object; and</li>
    <li>The current object's children.</li>
</ul>
<br>
-->
<h4>Action Buttons</h4>
<p>The bottom of the page displays some action buttons, <strong>Edit Object, Add Child Object</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong>. &nbsp;Whether a button is visible or invisible depends on the object&rsquo;s project Status, the user&rsquo;s repository role and project specific role, and the object&rsquo;s position in the domain model as well. &nbsp;</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>The <strong>Edit</strong> button takes the user to the Edit Object page for the current object (it is only displayed in Active project, and only available to repository administrator, project administrator and project member). It will be described in next section: <a href="./child_edit">Editing a Child Object</a>.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Add Child Object</strong> button enables the user to add a child object with the current object as the parent, and will take the user through the <a href="./child_add">Adding a Child Object</a> process as described in the previous section. (This button is only available if the model permits. For example, a Publication object does not allow for any child objects.)</li>
    <li>The <strong>Delete</strong> button is only available for the repository administrator or project administrator.</li>
</ul>
