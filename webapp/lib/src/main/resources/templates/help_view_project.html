<h3 class="underlined_heading">Viewing a Project</h3>
<br>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Users can view projects as determined by their repository role or project specific roles (same as <a href="./project_listing">Listing Projects</a>):&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Public users can view public access projects.</li>
    <li>Registered users can view public access projects and the projects they are associated with.</li>
    <li>Project Creators view public access projects and the projects they are associated with. They will not      have any view access over the project they created unless they define themselves with a project role during project creation.</li>
    <li>Administrators can view all projects.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Project View</h4>
<p>The authorised user can access the Project View via the following methods:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Creating and submitting a new project (the new project object has been instantiated and validated);</li>
    <li>From the View Project link after successfully uploading a new project;</li>
    <li>Clicking the Project Title link on the Listing Projects page.</li>
</ul>

<p class="rteleft"><em>Figure 11.1 &ndash; Project View (Administrator) in a collapsed state</em></p>
<p>The Project View is displayed in an expanded state by default. Figure 11.1 shows a screenshot of an Administrator User's Project  View with the Project Details section collapsed.</p>
<p>On the <strong>View Project</strong> page, there are two sections:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Project details, where the user can <a href="./view_project_details">View Project Details</a>, and</li>
    <li>File attachments, where the user can <a href="./view_attached_files">View Attached Files</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the user&rsquo;s repository and project specific role, different action buttons will be displayed at the bottom of the page.</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li><strong>Edit Object</strong> takes the user to Edit Project page where the user can edit the project details.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit Participants</strong> button takes the user to the <a href="./participants"><strong>Project Participants</strong></a> screen to view and update participants.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Child Object</strong> button takes the user to an Add Child Object page, through a Dialog to select the type of Child Object and parent-child relationship.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete Project</strong> button allows the authorised user to delete the project.</li>
    <li><strong>Publish</strong> Project button is displayed on the View Project page only when the Project is unpublished and the user is the Principal Investigator.</li>
</ul>
