<h3 class="underlined_heading">Editing a Child Object</h3>
<br>
<p>The <strong>Edit Object</strong> screen is arrived at by clicking the<strong> Edit</strong> button in the <strong>View Object</strong> screen.</p>
<p>The user is presented with an <strong>Edit Object</strong> screen (See figure 14.3.1). The screen is similar to the second stage of the <strong>Add Child Object</strong> screen, with the text boxes filled. All the sections are displayed in an expanded state by default.</p>

<!-- 
<h4>Parent Details</h4>
<p>The <strong>Parent Details</strong> section is exactly the same as in the <strong>Object View</strong> Page, with the parent object ID, title, type and relationship displayed in a read only mode.</p>
<br>
 -->
<h4>Object Details</h4>
<p>The <strong>Object Details</strong> section displays all the attributes of the object. Figure 14.3.1 shows an example of an Investigation object being edited. Object Title and Description can be modified. Some other fields may be available for editing depending on the type of the object.
<!-- At the bottom of the Object Details section, Creator, Creation date, Last modified by and Last modification date are displayed in a read only mode (which is not in the Add a Child Object page). --> 
</p>
<p>If the object allows RefersTo links, these too are displayed under the <strong>Object Details</strong> section. RefersTo fields should be modified using the auto completion functionality as shown in Figure 14.3.2. </p>

<h4>Action Buttons</h4>
<p>When satisfied with the changes, the user clicks <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>
<p>Validation is performed, and if any fields are in error then the user is returned to the top of the page. An error box will appear at top of the page describing the nature of the errors and remedial actions.</p>
<p>The system confirms the submission to the administrator by switching to the view tab and displaying the object details page in view (read only mode).</p>
<p>If the user clicks the <strong>Cancel </strong>button, the <strong>Edit Object</strong> screen will be abandoned. &nbsp;The screen is returned to the <strong>View Object</strong> page without any change.</p>
