<h3 class="underlined_heading">Adding a Child Object</h3>
<br>
<p>With the exception of a Project, all concrete PODD objects are instantiated with a reference to the parent object. However, not all objects can be a parent of another object. For example, a <em>Project Plan</em> can not have a child object.</p>
<p>Authorised users can add a child object by clicking the <strong>Add Child Object</strong> button when viewing the parent object. If the data model does not allow an object to have child objects, the <strong>Add Child Object</strong> button won't be available.</p>
<br>
<h4>Select Child Object Type (and Parent-Child Relationship)</h4>
<p>When the <strong>Add Child Object</strong> button is clicked, the <strong>Add Child</strong> Dialog is displayed as shown in Figure 14.1.1 below.</p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>Figure 14.1.1 &ndash; Screenshot of Add Child Dialog</em></p>
<p>The Dialog contains a drop down list containing all "Child Object Type - Parent-Child Relationship" combinations possible for the parent object  as shown in Figure 14.1.2 below.</p>

<p>When satisfied with the child object type and relationship, the user clicks <strong>Continue</strong>. (To cancel the process, click the Dialog's close button to return to the previous <strong>View Object</strong> page).</p>

<p>The user is presented with an updated <strong>Add Child Object</strong> screen. The screen is different depending on the type of the child object.</p>

<h4>Fill in the Child Object details</h4>
<p>The Child Object fields appearing are determined by the type of Child Object. The user has to fill these in and 
click the <strong>Submit</strong> button when satisfied.
Validation is performed and if any fields are in error then the user is returned to the top of the page. An error box will appear at the top of the page describing the nature of the errors.</p>
<p>On successful submission, the following universal attributes will be automatically recorded against the new child object:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>URI is determined by PODD.</li>
    <li>Creator is set to the current user.</li>
    <li>Creation Date is set to the current date.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system confirms the submission to the administrator by switching to the <strong>View</strong> tab and displaying the object details page in view (read only mode). See: <a href="./child_view">Viewing a Child Object</a> for details.</p>
<p>The user can also abort the process and return to view the parent object by selecting the <strong>Cancel</strong> button.</p>
