<h3 class="underlined_heading">Creating a Project</h3>
<br>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>PODD organizes all data into projects. To record any data or metadata, the first thing is to create a concept project object.</p>
<br>
<h4>Actors</h4>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Public users and registered users can&rsquo;t create projects.</li>
    <li>Project Creators may create projects. They will not have any further access over the project unless they define themselves with a project role during project creation. Note the default behaviour of the system is to give the Project Creator Project Administrator and Project Principal Investigator roles.</li>
    <li>Administrators may create and modify projects.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Creating a Project</h4>
<p>For the authorised users, i.e., the Project Creator and Repository Administrator, there is a <strong>Create Project</strong> button listed on the <strong>Listing Projects </strong>screen. Once the button is hit, the <strong>Add new Project</strong> page is displayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding a new Project consists of the following two steps:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li><a href="./project_details">add project details</a></li>
    <li><a href="./participants">add project participants</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- 
<p>A collapse/expand icon is listed next to the heading of each section. By clicking this icon, the section is switched bwtween collapsing and expanding state. All the three sections are displayed in expanding status by default when <strong>Create Project Object</strong> screen is initated. They are displayed in a collapsing statue here to reduce the size of the figure. Each section will be shown in an expanding state and discribed in details separately in the sub-sections listed at the bottom of this page.</p>
 -->
<p>At the bottom of the page, two buttons are listed for user to take some actions. They are: <a href="./priject_submit">Submit and Cancel.</a></p>
