<h3 class="underlined_heading">Adding Project Participants</h3>
<br>
<p>Project Participants are users who have Project specific roles. They have nominated CRUD accesses to the project while the project has a Project Status of current.</p>
<p>When a  Project is created, by default the creator is given the Principal Investigator and Project Administrator roles.</p>
<p>For authorised users, i.e. Project Administrators, there is an <strong>Edit Participants</strong> button in the <strong>View Project</strong> screen. When the button is clicked, the <strong>Project Participants</strong> screen is displayed.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 10.2.1, there are four types of project participants (see also <a href="./roles">Project Specific Roles</a>). They are:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Principal Investigator *
    <ul class="stylized-circle">
        <li>This field is mandatory, a project must have exactly one Principal Investigator at any time.</li>
        <li>A Principal Investigator should also be a Project Administrator in order to administer the Project.</li>
        <li>Principal Investigator can be replaced.</li>
        <li>To edit Principal Investigator, hover the mouse pointer over the current entry. The label will change into an editable text box.</li>
    </li>
    <li>Project Administrator
    <ul class="stylized-circle">
        <li>The project can have multiple Project Administrators.</li>
        <li>A default Project Administrator is already inserted in this field, being the person creating the project. This default can be edited out of the text field. Note this will have consequences when the creator submits the project.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Project Members
    <ul class="stylized-circle">
        <li>Project Members have Create, Read and Update access to all Project objects, and Delete access to internal Project objects.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Project Observers
    <ul class="stylized-circle">
        <li>Project Observers have Read only access to all Project objects.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Adding project participants makes use of the <a href="./participant_auto_complete">Auto-Completion</a> functionality.</p>
<p>The user adds participants to each field as required. Please be advised that only existing registered users can be added in the fields. One user can have several roles in a project.</p>
