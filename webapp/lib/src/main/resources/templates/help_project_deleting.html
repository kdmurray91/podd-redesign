<h3 class="underlined_heading">Deleting a Project</h3>
<br>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>When a Project is deleted, the Project and all its child objects are deleted in the underlying repository, and <strong>cannot be recovered</strong>. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the effects of deleting a Project.</p>
<p>Repository Administrators and Project Administrators can delete Projects.</p>
<br>
<h4>Delete a Project</h4>
<p>On the <strong>View Project</strong> page, if the user has the appropriate authority, the page will contain a <strong>Delete Project</strong> button.</p>
<p>When the user clicks the <strong>Delete Project</strong> button, a <strong>Confirmation Dialog</strong> is presented. The Dialog contains the Project's Title and asks the user to confirm that they wish to delete this Project. If the Project has child objects, the displayed message advises that these too will be deleted, as shown in the Figure below.</p>

<p>The user clicks the <strong>Confirm</strong> button. The system deletes the Project and any child objects it may have. If the user does not wish to proceed with the delete, press the <strong>Cancel</strong> button. The screen is returned to the Project View.</p>
<p>After successful deletion, the user is directed to the <strong>List Projects</strong> screen where it can be observed that the deleted Project is no longer listed.</p>
