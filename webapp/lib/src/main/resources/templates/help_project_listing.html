<h3 class="underlined_heading">Listing Projects</h3>
<br>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>A Project Object is considered the foundation object for any projects in PODD. That is, objects will exist in a hierarchy of relationships with a Project object as the top node. For this reason the first view that a user will see is the Projects tab with a list of projects that he/she may access.</p>
<br>
<h4>Actors</h4>
<p>All users, whether registered or public access, will be able to list projects. Two types of projects are defined in the system.&nbsp; They are:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Published Projects: Public access projects.</li>
    <li>Unpublished Projects: Projects that are not published. Non-admin users will only see projects that they are associated with. *</li>
</ul>
<p>Different types of projects will be listed based on the user's repository roles:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Public users can only list Published Projects.</li>
    <li>Registered users/Project Creators can list (their) Unpublished Projects and Published Projects.</li>
    <li>Administrators can list All Projects in the PODD instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>* A user is associated with a project if, they are defined as either a Project Administrator/Principal Investigator (CRUD access), Project Member (CRU) or Project Observer (R) of the project.</p>
<br>
<h4>The Project Pane</h4>
<p>When a user navigates to the PODD website without logging in, the default view is the Projects Pane. All Public access (i.e. Published) projects are listed in the Project Pane.</p>
<p>Once the user logs in, the Project Pane will list all unpublished projects the user is associated with and all public access projects (Published Projects).</p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>Figure 8.1 &ndash; Default Listing Projects View in Projects Tab for a registered user</em></p>
<p>As shown in Figure 8.1, for each Project object listed in the Project Pane the following information is available:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>The Project Title (Links to Browser View of the project);</li>
<!--
	<li>The user's project specific role (in brackets), will be either:<br />
    <ul class="stylized-circle">
        <li>Project Administrator</li>
        <li>Principal Investigator</li>
        <li>Project Member</li>
        <li>Project Observer</li>
        <li>Public access</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Principal Investigator, prefaced by the term Principal Investigator (it won't be repeated if the user is the Principal Investigator);</li>
    <li>The Lead Institution, prefaced by the term Lead Institution;</li>
-->    
    <li>Project description. First 200 characters, whole words (no breaks in words) or to first line return, which ever comes first;</li>
    <li>A Browse Project Link, which takes the user to the Browser View of the project (same as the link behind the project title).</li>
</ul>
<p>Unpublished Projects and Published Projects are separated in the view.</p>
<p>A Repository Administrator will, by default, have a listing of All Projects.</p>
<p>Both Unpublished Projects and Published Projects can be hidden by clicking the collapse icon next to the headings (see Figure 8.1).</p>
<br>
<h5>Action Buttons</h5>
<p>There are also additional buttons displayed for different user roles:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li><strong>Create Projects</strong> button is only visible to Project Creator and Repository Administrator. It will take user to the Create Project function (see Creating a Project). &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Upload Project as RDF</strong> button is visible to Project Creator and Repository Administrator. It will take user to the Upload New Project function.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<!-- 
<h5>Pagination</h5>
<p>Where a list of projects exceeds the on screen maximum (20) a list of page numbers will be displayed at the bottom for the user to page through the project list. This pagination function will exist for both Published Projects and Unpublished Projects. So if there are more than 20 Unpublished Projects and the user selects the next page then the Unpublished Projects list would be updated and not the Published Projects list, and vice versa for Published Projects.</p>
