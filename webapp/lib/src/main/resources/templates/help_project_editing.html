<p>Creator, Creation Date, Last modified by and Last modified date are not user updatable.</p>
<br>
<h4>Validation</h4>
<p>Validation is performed when the user clicks <strong>Submit</strong>. If any fields are in error then the user is returned to the top of the page. An error box will appear at top of the page describing the nature of the errors and remedial action.<br />
The system confirms the submission to the user by switching to the view tab and displaying the project details page in view (read only mode).<br />
The following additional values will be automatically updated against the Project concrete object:</p>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Last Modified by is set as the current user</li>
    <li>Last Modified on is set to the current date</li>
</ul>
<p>The user may click <strong>Cancel</strong> instead of Submit to abandon the Edit Screen and get back to the View Screen.</p>
<br>
<p>Updating project participants is the same as in <a href="./participants">Adding Project Participants</a> during Project creation.</p>
<p>Attaching File References is the same as in <a href="./file_attach">Attaching File References</a> during Project creation.</p>
