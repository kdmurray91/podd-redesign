<h3 class="underlined_heading">Deleting a Child Object</h3>
<br>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>When an object is deleted, it is deleted in the underlying repository, and <strong>cannot be recovered</strong>.</p>
<p>Deleting an object is cascaded to any child objects that it may have. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the effects of deleting an object.</p>
<br>
<h4>Actors</h4>
<ul class="stylized">
    <li>Repository Administrators, Project Administrators and Project Members can delete child objects.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Delete an Object</h4>
<p>On the <strong>View Object</strong> page, if the user has the appropriate authority the object view will display a <strong>Delete</strong> button.</p>
<p>When the user clicks the <strong>Delete</strong> button, a <strong>Confirmation Dialog</strong> is presented. The Dialog contains the object's Title and asks the user to confirm that they wish to delete this object. If the object has child objects, the displayed message advises that these too will be deleted, as shown in Figure 15.1.1.</p>

<p>The user clicks the <strong>Confirm</strong> button. The system deletes the object and any child objects it may have. If the user does not wish to proceed with the delete, press the <strong>Cancel</strong> button. The screen is returned to the Object View.</p>
<p>After successful deletion, the user is directed to the <strong>View Object</strong> screen for the parent object where it can be observed that the deleted object is no longer available as a child.</p>
