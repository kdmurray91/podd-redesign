<h3 class="underlined_heading">Handling Deleted Objects</h3>
<br>
<p>If an object is copied to the Clipboard and subsequently deleted then it will still be visible on the Clipboard, but not selectable. It will have the word deleted highlighted in red next to the object title, but not hyperlinked to the object's view (see Figure 16.4.1). This also applies to file data streams.</p>

<p class="rteleft"><em>Figure 16.4.1 &ndash; Clipboard with deleted objects and altered predicate.</em></p>
<p>If the parent of the deleted object is also deleted then it will not be hyperlinked and will have the word deleted highlighted in red next to the object title.</p>
<p>The above situation also applies where all objects associated with a predicate have been deleted. The predicate will be marked as deleted and will not be available for a copy operation (keeping an empty predicate on the Clipboard).</p>
<p>If only some (not all) objects associated with a predicate have been deleted then this will be reflected in the Clipboard view. The original object count is shown and the number of deleted objects shown, as per the hasPlatform predicate in Figure 16.4.1.</p>
<p>When an object or predicate is deleted between being visible on the  <i>Clipboard</i> and being pasted, the system will process the paste request and  will alert the user via the <strong>Copy &amp; Paste Results</strong> screen.</p>
<p>If a predicate is pasted and child objects have been deleted then the <strong>Copy &amp; Paste Results</strong> screen will give a warning along the lines of Warning: nn predicates deleted.</p>
